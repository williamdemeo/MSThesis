The rate at which a Markov chain converges to a given probability distribution has long been an
active area of research. Well known bounds on this rate of convergence involve the subdominant
eigenvalue of the chain’s underlying transition probability matrix. However, many transition prob-
ability matrices are so large that we are unable to store even a vector of the matrix in fast computer
memory. Thus, traditional methods for approximating eigenvalues are rendered useless.

In this paper we demonstrate that, if the Markov chain is reversible, and we under-
stand the structure of the chain, we can derive the coefficients of the traditional Lanczos algo-
rithm without storing a single vector. We do this by considering the variational properties of
observables on the chain’s state space. In the process we present the classical theory which re-

lates the information contained in the Lanczos coefficients to the eigenvalues of the Markov chain.
