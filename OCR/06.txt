a.llBES,

p(x,,+1 e B | a(Xo, . . . ,X,.)) = P(X,.+1 e B 1 o(X,,)) (2.1)

Equation (2.1) merely states that, given the present location of X,,, the past is irrelevant for

predicting the location of X,,+1.

Deﬁnition 2.1.2 A function p : S x S —> R is said to be a transition probability if:
1. for each :1: E S, A —> p(a:, A) is a probability measure on (S, S).
2. for each A E 8, :1: —> p(z, A) is a measurable function.

We call X,, a Markov chain with transition probabilities 12,, if
P(Xn+l E B l a(Xn)) =Pn(XnaB) (22)

The spaces (S, S) that we encounter below are standard Borel spaces, so the existence of the
transition probabilities follows from the existence of regular conditional probabilities on Borel spaces
— a standard measure theory result (see e.g. [3] page 230).

Suppose we are given an initial probability distribution p on (S, S) and a sequence p,, of

transition probabilities. We can deﬁne a consistent set of ﬁnite dimensional distributions by

P<X,- e B,-,0 s 1 s n) = / #(d1‘o) / Po($o.d-'51) . .. / Pn-l(97n—1ad$n) (2.3)

Furthermore, denote our probability space by
(9,?) = (S{0,1,...},8{0,l,...})

We call this sequence space and it is deﬁned more explicitly by

sf°»1=-~-} = {(wo,w1,...) :w.- e S}

S{°*1""} = ¢7(w :40; E A,- E 3)
