begun in any initial state, the ﬁnal state is a sample point from a distribution which is close to 1r.

To make this statement more precise requires that we deﬁne “close”.

Deﬁnition 2.1.5 Let 1r be a probability measure on S. Then the total variation distance at time

n with initial state I is given by
AA") = l|P"(z, A) - 7r(-4)||Tv = 1333; I P"(I.A) - 7r(A) I

In what follows, we will measure rate of convergence using the function 'r,(e), the first time after

which the total variation distance is always less than 5. That is,
-r,,(e) = min{m : A,(n) 3 E for all n. 2 m}

To consider the connection between convergence rates and eigenvalues, note that an ape-
riodic stochastic matrix P has real eigenvalues 1 = /\o > A1 2 A2 3  Z /\¢_1 2 -1, where
d = |S'] is the dimension of the state space. For an ergodic chain, the rate of convergence to the
stationary distribution 7r is bounded by a function of the subdominant eigenvalue. By subdominant
eigenvalue we mean that eigenvalue which is second-largest in absolute value, and we denote this
Am“ E max{).1,|A¢_1|}. The function bounding the rate of convergence is given by the following

theorem:

Theorem 2.1.2

The quantity T1(€) satisﬁes
1. 13(5) 5 (1 — /\m,_x)“(ln1r(a:)‘1 +1ne‘1)
2. maxxes r,(e) 2 %/\,,,,x(1 — ).,,,,x)‘1ln(2e)’1

As this theorem shows, if we have an upper bound on the subdominant eigenvalue, then we have

an upper bound on the function 11(5). In what follows, we will derive an approximation to the
