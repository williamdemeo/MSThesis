mind, we will consider using the covariance of observables on the state space to implement the
(otherwise useless) Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, which we describe below. This procedure requires
that M be symmetric. As the next fact demonstrates, this required symmetry is the reason for our

interest in the reversibility property of the Markov chain.

Fact 2.2.1 The matrix M is symmetric if and only if the Markov chain is reversible (i.e. iﬂ the

process satisﬁes the detailed balance condition).

Proof:

M is symmetric

4:, (1-I1/2P1-I-1/2): = H1/2Pn—1/2

Element-wise, the ﬁnal equality implies that 7|‘,'p,'j = 1rjpj.-. According to Deﬁnition 2.1.3, this states

that p is a reversible measure.
