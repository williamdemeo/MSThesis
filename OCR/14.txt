is said to be invariant for M.

Recall that, having chosen observables <I> = ((151, . . . , qﬁp), we constructed the covariance
matrix C(s) = \II‘M"\II. If the column space of \II, which we denote by ran(\II), is an invariant
subspace for M, the deﬁnition implies Miﬁj E  That is, for each 111,- there exists a vector
t of coeﬂicients such that M1/Jj = f=1t,-1/)5,-. This is true for all j and, putting each vector of
coefficients into a matrix T, we see that M\II = \IIT. Conversely, M\II = IIIT implies that M1/Jj is a

linear combination of columns of \II, so ran(\II) is invariant. We have thus proved the following
