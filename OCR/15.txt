Fact 3.1.1 The subspace ran(\II) is invariant for M if and only if there exists T E R”? such that

M\II = \IIT.

Consequently,

Fact 3.1.2 )\(T) Q ).(M)

Proof of 3.1.2:

z\E)\(T) _=_ 3v€R"3Tv=).v
<=> \IITv = A\IIv
<=> M\II-u = /\\IIv
<$ /\ E /\(M)

The second ¢> follows from fact 3.1.1.
Facts 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are theoretically useful. To see why, write the equation of fact 3.1.1

as follows:

\IIT = M\II
\II‘\IIT = \II‘M\II
T = (\1:'~1r)-‘\1:'M\1:

In this form, we recognize that T = C‘1(0)C(1). That is, using only the covariance of observables
on the state space, we can generate a matrix T with the property A(T) (_Z ).(M). Recalling that
M = H1/2Pl'I‘1/2, we see that M is similar to our original stochastic matrix P, and thus ).(M) =

).(P).

3.2 Approximate Invariant Subspace

We qualiﬁed the foregoing by stating that the facts are only theoretically useful. This

is because when choosing observables of the state space we aren't sure that they will satisfy the
