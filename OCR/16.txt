primary assumption underlying facts 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. Recall the assumption: ran(\II) is an invariant
subspace for M, where ‘II = H1/2(<I> —  It may well be the case that there is a 1p; 6 ran(\II) such
that M1/zj ¢ ran(\II), thereby violating the assumption. However, lacking an invariant subspace, we

might hope that our observables at least provide an approximate invariant subspace.

Deﬁnition 3.2.1 If the columns of ‘II E R“? are independent and the residual matrix E E

M\II —— \IIT is small for some T 6 R7”, then ran(\II) deﬁnes an approximate invariant subspace.

To see how an approximate invariant subspace can be useful in approximating eigenvalues of M,

we extract a theorem from Golub and Van Loan 

Theorem 3.2.1
Suppose M 6 Rd” and T 6 RP"? are symmetric and let E E MQ — QT, where Q 6 Rd"? satisﬁes

Q‘Q = I. Then there exist p1,... ,;z,, E A(T) and A1,. . . , A,, E A(M) such that
ll‘k - Akl S \/§|lE"

fork=1,...,p.

If the subspace ran(Q) is an approximate invariant subspace, then the deﬁnition implies that
there is a choice T rendering the error IIEII2 small, and thus, the eigenvalues of T provide a good
approximation to those of M.

When considering the preceding ideas, it becomes apparent that their application will
present new — but hopefully less prohibitive — problems. As these problems summarize the rt of
the paper, now is a good time to examine them. First, the preceding theorem assumes a matrix Q
whose columns form an orthonormal basis for the approximate invariant subspace. For our problem,
derivation of such a Q is tricky, and we must prepare for this. Next, having an approximate invariant

subspace at our disposal merely tells us that there exists some matrix T which makes the error
