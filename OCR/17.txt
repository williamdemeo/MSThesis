"EH2 small. We must discover the form of such a T. Moreover, it is natural to seek that T which
minimizes IIEII2 for a given approximate invariant subspace. Finally, in order to apply these ideas
to real examples of our eigenvalue problem, we must ﬁnd a practical way to generate the most
appropriate approximate invariant subspace. We now address each of these issues in the order
raised.

Recall the matrix I1 E III/2(<I> — (<I>)). The columns of this matrix, though independent
(by choice of independent observables), are not necessarily orthonormal. However, consider the
polar decomposition ‘II = QZ where Q‘Q = I and Z2 = \Il‘\II is symmetric positive semideﬁnite.1

Note that Z = (\II‘\II)l/2 is nonsingular, so Q has the form
Q = ~1:z-1 = \II(\II‘\II)“/2

and it is clear that ran(Q) = ran(\II). Perhaps ra.n(Q) is a. useful approximation to the invariant
subspace for M. If ran(Q) is not itself invariant, we have the error E = MQ — QT. It is easy to
show, as we do in the following proof, that the T which minimizes HE“; is T = Q‘MQ. This yields

the following,
Theorem 3.2.2

If \I1 = QZ is the polar decomposition of \II, then the matrix
T = Q‘MQ = (\1:*\1:)-1/’\1:‘M\I:(\Ir‘\I:)-1/2
minimizes IIEII2 = IIMQ - QTII2

Proof:
We prove the result by establishing the following

(Hal: Given M 6 Rd” suppose Q 6 Rd"? satisﬁes Q'Q =1. Then,

min ||MQ — QTII2 = H(1- QQ')MQll2

‘Recall that the polar decomposition is derived from the SVD, \II = UZJV‘, by letting Q = UV‘ and Z = VEV‘.
