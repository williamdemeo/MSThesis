and T = Q’MQ is the minimizer.
To verify the claim, observe the following application of the Pythagorean theorem:

For any T E R.”"” we have

IIMQ — QT||§ = IIMQ - QQ'MQ + QQ'MQ - QT|l§
||(I - QQ’)MQ + Q(Q'MQ - T) H3

||(1 - QQ‘)MQ||§ + |lQ(Q'MQ - T)||§ (3-1)

2 l|(I — QQ')MQ||§

Equality (3.1) holds since I — QQ' projects MQ onto the subspace orthogonal to ran(Q). Thus,
the two terms in the expression on the right are orthogonal, and the Pythagorean theorem yields
equality. The concluding inequality establishes that the minimizing T is that which annihilates the
second term in (3.1); i.e. T = Q‘MQ.

The second equality in Theorem 3.2.2 is a consequence of the polar decomposition, in

which Q = \IIZ“ = \I:(~I:‘\I:)-1/2. Therefore,
T = (x1z'x1:)-1/2x1:‘M~1:(\1:*~1z)—1/2

is the minimizer.

3.3 The Krylov Subspace

Suppose the columns of a matrix Q E R“? provide an orthonormal basis for an approxi-

mate invariant subspace. Then we have seen,
1. T = Q'MQ minimizes ||E||2 = ||MQ — QT||2 and
2. E|p.1,...,p,, E z\(T) and /\1,...,A, 6 »\(M) such that
