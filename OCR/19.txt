Given an approximate invariant subspace ran(Q) of dimension 1), these facts tell us what matrix we
should use to approximate p elements of M’s spectrum. Now all we lack is a. description of ran(Q).
That is, we have not speciﬁed which approximate invariant subspace would best suit our objective

of approximating the subdominant eigenvalue A,,.a2:(M). 'I‘o do so requires the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 3.3.1 The Raleigh quotient of a symmetric matrix M and a nonzero vector 3 is

p(2:, M) E (:z:‘Ma:)/(z‘a:).

We will also denote this by p(z) when the context makes clear what matrix is involved.

To ﬁnd the approximate invariant subspace most appropriate for our problem, we choose
each dimension successively, providing justiﬁcation at each step. Thus, start with one observable
42 on the state space, and let zpl E 111/ 2(¢ — E,,¢). That is, 1/:1 represents a centered (mean zero)
observable whose ith coordinate is weighted by . First notice that the deﬁnition (which comes
directly from the deﬁnition of ‘II following equation (2.7)) is such that 1/)1 is a constant vector if
and only if :15 is oonstant on the state space, in which case 1/); E 0. This fact provides one reason
observables that are constant on the state space are not interesting. Second, recall that the row
sums of the matrix P are all one and, therefore, the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue
Ao(P) = 1 is the constant vector. By deﬁnition of M E 1'11/2Pl'I‘1/2, we see that the constant vector
is also the eigenvector corresponding to A0  This will play an important role in what follows, as
it allows us to focus primarily on the subdominant eigenvalue z\max(M) E max{}q (M), [A44 
rather than on A0  (which we already know is 1).

Now, notice that

lP(¢1,M)l 5 max |P(x,M)l = »\max(M) (3-2)
