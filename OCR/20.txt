where the max is taken over all non-constant vectors. Since our interest centers on An-.3_x(M), we
would like a. 1/11 which makes the left hand side of (3.2) large. This would be achieved if 1/)1 were to
lie in the space spanned by, say, the first two eigenvectors of the Markov chain (sometimes referred
to as the slowest modes of the process). However, this subspace spans only two dimensions of the
entire d-dimensional space, and it is more likely that ¢1, at best, only comes close to lying in the
subspace of interest. Now, given 1/11, a judicious choice for the second dimension l/)2, and hence
W; E [1/)1 1/:2], would be that which makes max,,¢o |p(\II2a)| is as large as possible. To establish that

this is indeed the pertinent objective, note the following:

   

_ a‘\1:5Mx1:2a
I;1;g<Ip(\I'2a,M)l = 13:3: ————a,W§q,2a
= M
mrggf,mIp(z. )1
5 maxlp(z,M)l (3-3)
= ).,,m(M)

Again, the max on the right side of (3.3) is over non-constant vectors. In words, we wish to chose
\II-2 = [1/:1 ¢2] so that there is a vector a 6 R2 making |p(\II2a,M)| close to )«max(M).

Now, p(1/11) changes most rapidly in the direction of the gradient Vp(¢1).

W0  (iiiiiiv---viiiléi)
= ,,;,l (Mam — p<¢.)«m (3.4)

So, to maximize the left hand side of (3.3), ‘I12 should be chosen so that the subspace ra.n(\II2)

contains the gradient vector. That is, we must choose 1/22 so that

VP(¢'1) E F3l1{¢1y¢2} E F-'%!1(‘I’2) (3-5)

Clearly, equation (3.4) implies Vp(1/:1) E ran{z/11,M1,b1}. Therefore, if ran{1/:1,1/)2} = ra.n{¢1,M¢1},

then (3.5) is satisﬁed.
