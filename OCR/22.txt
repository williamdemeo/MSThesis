Lanczos Procedures

The following will review the usual procedure for generating an orthonormal basis for
lC(M, «/11, p), and conclude by showing that, for our problem, we can find the matrix Q‘MQ without
actually carrying out this procedure. Note that this conclusion is essential since the procedure

requires matrix vector multiplication - an operation we have assumed impossible for large enough :1.

4.1 The General Lanczos Algorithm
Let 21;“) E M"¢ and consider the d x :1 matrix
«I 2 [«/»,M«/»,  ,M"“¢] 2 [«b‘°>,«/»“’,...,¢<‘-‘>1

Notice that M\II = [1/:(1),... ,1/;(d'1),Md¢r] and, assuming for the moment that \I1 is non-singular,

we can compute the vector h = —\II‘1M"1/J. Thus,

M\II = \II[e2,. . . ,e,1, —h] E IIIH
