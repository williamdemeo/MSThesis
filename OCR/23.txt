H is a companion matrix which means that its characteristic polynomial is p(:r) = 2:‘ + 23:1 h,-:r"‘1.
Since H is similar to M, ﬁnding the eigenvalues of M is equivalent to ﬁnding the roots of p(a:).
However, this is of little practical use since ﬁnding h, constructing 12(1), and ﬁnding its roots is
probably a harder problem than the one we started with. Instead, the value of decomposition (4.1)
derives from its upper Hessenberg form. We exploit this property below.

Let ‘II = QR be the QR decomposition of \II. Since ‘I! is assumed nonsingular,
~II;‘M~r.: = (R"Q‘)M(QR) = H
Therefore,
Q‘MQ = RHR-1 2 T

Since R and R“1 are both upper triangular and H is upper Hessenberg, T = R.HR'1 is also upper
Hessenberg. Furthermore, since M is symmetric, it is clear that T‘ = Q‘MQ = T. That is, T is

an upper Hessenberg matrix that is symmetric. Therefore, T is tridiagonal and we can write it as

follows:

T =    (4.2)
