Equating columns j on both sides of MQ = QT yields
M113‘ = B,-—1qj—1 + 0:91 + ﬁjqj+1 (43)

Since the columns of Q are orthonormal, multiplying both sides of (4.3) by q_,- and q,-+1 yields
oz, = q§Mq,- and ﬂj = q;-+1Mq,-.
The foregoing justifies what is called the Lanczos algorithm, performed as follows:

The Lanczos algorithm for (partial) reduction to symmetric tridiaganal form

91 = ¢/||¢||2, [30 = 0, 40 = 0

for j=1top

z=Mq_,-

5:‘ = ||Z||2
if 5, = 0, quit
¢Ij+1 = 2/51

end for

The qj computed by the Lanczos algorithm are often called the Lanczos vectors. If the
loop in the algorithm is terminated because ﬁg = 0, this indicates that an exact invariant subspace
has been computed, and is given by ran{q1 - - - qk}. Otherwise, we usually halt the algorithm after
p steps, in which case the algorithm converg to approximations of at most 12 eigenvalues.‘

Note that equation (4.3) results from the equation MQ = QT. The latter equation holds
since, starting with d vectors in our subspace, Q is a d Xd matrix whose columns form an orthonormal

basis for all of R‘, which is clearly an invariant “sub” space. The Lanczos algorithm above, however,

‘A detailed discussion of such convergence (and misconvergence) is given in
