proceeds for only p steps, producing a d x p matrix Q, whose columns form an orthonormal basis
for the approximate invariant subspace IC(M, ¢, p), and a p X p matrix T, = Q'MQ. In that case,
IIMQ = QTp|[g =  is non-zero and gives the error bound described in Theorem 3.2.1. Now,

writing the full d x :1 matrix T of (4.2) as

allows us to describe the error bound ||E||-2 in terms of the submatrix Tm, and, hence, in terms of
