4.2 A Lanczos Procedure for Markov Chains

Notice that the Lanczos algorithm requires the computation of Mqj. Throughout this
paper we have assumed that M 6 Rd“, and that d is so large as to make the matrix vector
multiplication Mqj impossible. Now, the Lanczos algorithm constructs an orthonormal basis for
the Krylov subspace. For our purposes, this construction is not essential. What is essential is that
we ﬁnd a way to generate the Lanczos coejﬁcients oz,-, ﬁj, (j = 1, . . . , p), and whence the matrix
T, without performing the operation Mqj required by the Lanczos algorithm. We now address this
problem.

Begin with the centered and weighted observable 1/1 = 111/ 2 (qS—E,,¢), and let q1 = 11;/||1/JH2.
To simplify notation, let ¢(n) E ¢(X,.). The form of the first Lanczos coeﬂicient a1 is straight

forward:

01 = qiMq1

I/1‘M1/I
¢’¢

and now the special properties of the Markov chain setting play an important role. For, regard the

following

¢‘M«/2 = (¢ — E.¢)‘II%‘MII%(¢ - Em)

Cw (d>(n), ¢(" + 1)) (4-5)

and

W1!’ = (<15 - E«¢)'H(¢ - E«¢)

Varn (¢(")) (4-6)

Recall that the deﬁnition of M implies H%‘MI'I% = HP, and this justiﬁes equation (4.5). Putting
