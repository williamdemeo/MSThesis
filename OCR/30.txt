An Application: Convergence to

Gibbs Measure on the Ising Lattice

5.1 Physical Motivation

Before considering the details of the Metropolis algorithm, it helps to understand the
setting in which it was developed. To do so we consider an typical example, the Ising model.
Consider a model of a system consisting of 71 “sites”, each site taking values in {-1, +1}. It might
help to imagine these sites as equally spaced points on a line or a circle, though we are not restricted
to such cases. Then our state space 5' consists of all possible n—dimensional permutations of -1’s
and +1’s. We reprent this as S’ = {-1, +1}", and note that |S| = 2". We can think ofeach site as
a node existing in one of two possible positions, say “on" or “off”. Each state 1' E S is represented
by a unique permutation a.- of —1’s and +1’s. Let a,-(k) = :|:l denote the position (on or off) of
the kth node when the system is in state 1'. An observable ¢ = qS(a,-) on this space is a function of

the permutations 47,-, 1' 6 {1,. . . , 2"}.
