The energy of the system, when in state i, is deﬁned by the Hamiltonian

H07-‘) = - Z Ua(i)0s(k)

<j Ic>
where the sum runs over all neart neighbor pairs. In statistical mechanics we are often concerned

with the Gibbs measure of state i, deﬁned by
1r(a,-) = Z'1 exp{—[3H(a,~)} (5.1)
where Z ‘1 is the normalization constant, or partition function. For the Ising model, we put

Z = §:9XP{~ﬁH(<7:‘)}
i=1

so that 7r is a probability measure. Now, letting 1: denote the so called Boltzman constant, if a
classical mechanical system is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings with absolute temper-
ature T, and is in state i with energy H (05), then the probability density in phase-space of the
point representing state i is given by (5.1) with [3 = (lcT)“. The central result of ergodic theory
implies that we can also interpret 1r(o;) as the proportion of time the system spends in state i. If

the system is observed at a random time, the expectation E,,¢ of any observable ¢ is thus

(5.2)

Perhaps the number of sites n in our Ising model is so large that it is impractical or impossible to
evaluate (5.2). We might instead consider importance sampling and generate states with probability

density

exp{—aH<a.o}
2?;.exp{—zaH<a.->} (53)

Then «I: is itself an unbiased estimator of (5.2).

If evaluation of (5.2) is difficult, there is no reason to believe that evaluation of (5.3) is any

easier. However, Metropolis and his collaborators [9] contrived a method for producing an ergodic
