The procedure we employ below involves a slight variation: choose site .9 at random uniformly
from the 11 possible sites. However, instead of changing the value of the chosen site with absolute
certainty, as in Glauber dynamics, we “ﬂip the switch” with probability 1/2. Therefore, when k yé .9

we have 0',-(k) = a.~(k), and when k = 3,

—a,~(s) with probability 1/2
01(3) =

a,-(3) with probability 1/2
The advantage of this procedure is that the proposition matrix, before altering it with the Metropo-
lis algorithm, is a bit more interesting than that produced by traditional Glauber dynamics. For,
it has 1/2 along the main diagonal and, thus, is aperiodic and converges to a stationary distribu-
tion. Glauber dynamics has period 2, so its proposition matrix does not satisfy the hypotheses of

our convergence theorem (Theorem 2.1.2). Keep in mind, however, that any proposition matrix

modiﬁed by the Metropolis algorithm satisﬁes all of our hypotheses.

5.4.1 Computer Programs

Constructing a computer program to simulate realizations of the Markov chain described
above (i.e. with transition matrix K) is straight forward, and we do so using Matlab and the
program ising.m which appears in the Appendix.

When performing simulations in the present context, there are a few important aspects
to consider. First, our program begins with a “hot start", which means that the initial state is
picked by assigning each site to :l:1 with probability 1/2. Perhaps we should instead have picked
our initial state from the stationary distribution. On the contrary, this would defeat the whole

purpose of our analysis. Recall that the method has been developed to deal with cases for which
