number of desired Lauczos coeﬁicients. That is, the observable could have come from a simulation
of any reversible Markov chain and not just our special Metropolis chain. The output of this
program is a T matrix containing the maximum number of Lauczos coeﬂicients (up to the number
requested by the user) before an approximate invariant subspace was reached. The eigenvalues of
the nonzero part of this matrix, in accordance with the foregoing theory, should well approximate

eigenvalues of the Markov chain’s stochastic matrix.

5.4.2 Results

Table 1 shows the results of 5 simulations each of 100,000 iterations (discarding the ﬁrst
5,000 observations) for the one dimensional Ising lattice with 10 nodes and [7 = 1. Displayed is
the estimate of the ﬁrst Lauczos coeﬂicient a1 (which is the eigenvalue estimate after one step; i.e.
).m,x(T1)), along with its error bound ﬁl. Appearing in the third column is the largest eigenvalue of
the 2 x 2 matrix T2, A0 (T2), and ﬁg appears in the fourth column when it is was computable. When
it was not computable, it was probably because an approximate invariant subspace was reached
at the ﬁrst step, so ﬁg involved expressions which were close to machine epsilon and, thus, could
not be computed accurately. Table 2 shows the same information when using a second observable,
¢2 E ¢§ (i.e. the number of +1’s squared).

The true value of the subdominant eigenvalue for this problem is /\max(K) = 0.998746,

and the next largest is A2(K) = 0.993303. These were computed directly from the transition matrix
