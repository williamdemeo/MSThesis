most eﬂicient traditional method for computing only a few eigenvalues of K. However, recall that
the primary motivation for the new method are those examples where the matrix K is so large
that we can’t store even a single vector in fast memory. Once we start swapping data to and from
cheap memory, the time required by traditional algorithms can become years, even lifetimes. Such
examples are not exceptional. Consider, for instance, the 1000 node problem which produces a.
