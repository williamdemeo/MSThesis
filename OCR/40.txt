Conclusion

We conclude by noting a few aspects of the special cases to which the foregoing applies.
We are interested in the subdominant eigenvalue of a large transition probability matrix. The

foregoing can be used to approximate these eigenvalues when the following conditions are satisﬁed:
o The Markov chain is reversible (detailed balance condition).

0 We can easily simulate realizations of the chain as well as functions (observables) of these

realizations.

When these conditions hold, we can side step the traditional Lanczos algorithm, and get at the
values of the Lanczos coeﬂicients via the variational properties of observables on the state space.
There are many ideas in this paper that should be expanded upon in future studies. Per-
haps most obvious is the desire to ﬁnd analogous techniques for non-reversible (i.e. non-symmetric)
Markov chains. This is a considerable problem since the Lanczos methods described above are no
longer applicable. Perhaps the Amoldi algorithm ([1], algorithm 6.9), or the non-symmetric Lanczos

algorithm can also be usefully specialized for stochastic matrices.
