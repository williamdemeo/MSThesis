When applying the Lanczos algorithm, we usually choose a single starting vector (in the
present context, an observable), perform the algorithm for a number of steps, and gather results.
Then we do the same with a new starting vector and compare the results to those obtained with
the ﬁrst vector. Proceeding in this way for a number of starting vectors, we can provide statistical
evidence that we have, indeed, located the eigenvalues of interest. However, when there are two
observables 451, :15; of particular interest, perhaps we would beneﬁt by considering both observables
simultaneously. Future studies might develop an algorithm which incorporates both observables,

again via ¢.- = H1/2(¢.' - E,.¢.-). In this case, a Lanczos algorithm would be based on the space

Ic*(M,¢1,¢»2.p) 2 ran{«/»mz»2,M«/»1,M«/:2, . . .,MP—‘¢1.M"—‘«/22}

The Lanczos coeﬁicients would then involve not only the autocovariances C, (¢,<(n),¢,-(n + m)),

but also the cross-covariances C, (¢.~(n), ¢j(n + m)) (deﬁned in (2.6)).
