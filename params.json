Well known bounds on this rate of\r\nconvergence involve the subdominant eigenvalue of the chain's underlying\r\ntransition probability matrix. However, many transition probability matrices are\r\nso large that we are unable to store even a vector of the matrix in fast\r\ncomputer memory. Thus, traditional methods for approximating eigenvalues are\r\nrendered useless. \r\n\r\nIn this paper we demonstrate that, if the Markov chain is reversible, and we\r\nunderstand the structure of the chain, we can derive the coefficients of the\r\ntraditional Lanczos algorithm without storing a single vector. We do this by\r\nconsidering the variational properties of observables on the chain's state\r\nspace. In the process we present the classical theory which relates the\r\ninformation contained in the Lanczos coefficients to the eigenvalues of the\r\nMarkov chain. \r\n\r\nFiles in the repository\r\n-----------------------\r\nThe main document is [msthesis.pdf](https://github.com/williamdemeo/MSThesis/raw/master/msthesis.pdf).  It is the only file you need if you want to read the thesis.  \r\n\r\nThe other files in the repository are the LaTeX source code (msthesis.tex) and the computer programs (in the src directory) for running the simulations described in the thesis.\r\n\r\nAll of the LaTeX source code is contained in a single file, msthesis.tex, which can be compiled with the following command\r\n\r\n    pdflatex msthesis.tex\r\n    \r\nto produce the msthesis.pdf file, assuming you have a reasonably good installation of the TeXLive package or its equivalent. \r\n\r\nThe computer program files are in the **src** directory.  I have not tested them recently.  If you try them and encounter a problem, *please [submit an issue](https://github.com/williamdemeo/MSThesis/issues)*.\r\n","google":"UA-44974674-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
